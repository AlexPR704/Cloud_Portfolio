# Cloud Resume Challenge - Build
Welcome! This is my end-to-end deployment of a cloud-native resume site built on AWS, using infrastructure as code, CI/CD, and Python-based Lambda for backend logic.

## Features
- Static site hosted via S3 + CloudFront
- Secure access with HTTPS and custom DNS
- Visitor counter using JavaScript, API Gateway, and Lambda
- Visitor tracking stored in DynamoDB
- Infrastructure deployed with Terraform
- Unit tests with `pytest` and mocking
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions for backend reliability
- Fully version-controlled repo

## Why I Built This
This project was part of the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev) with a twist to strengthen my cloud engineering skills. I wanted to create a production-grade setup using best practices in automation, testing, and security.

## Tech Stack
Technology	- Purpose
AWS - S3	Hosts the static HTML/CSS resume site
Amazon - CloudFront	Distributes content globally with HTTPS
Route 53 - Manages DNS and custom domain settings
AWS Lambda - Runs Python backend logic for visitor counter
API Gateway	- Connects frontend JavaScript to backend Lambda function
DynamoDB - Stores and updates visitor count
Python 3.12 - Powers the Lambda function and local development
Boto3 - AWS SDK for interacting with DynamoDB
pytest - Framework used to write and run unit tests
Terraform - Manages AWS infrastructure as code
GitHub Actions - Automates CI/CD for backend testing and deployment

## Unit Testing
The Lambda function includes robust unit tests that validate both success and failure scenarios:

* Successful DynamoDB updates Ensures correct visitor count increments are returned

* Simulated DynamoDB failures Uses mocking to verify graceful error handling and appropriate 500 responses

To run the tests locally with pytest:

- bash
- pytest

All test dependencies are managed via requirements.txt, and the tests automatically run on every GitHub push thanks to CI/CD integration.
